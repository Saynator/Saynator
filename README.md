- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saynator but you can call me Gaynator
- 👀 I’m interested in rizzing you up
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intimate things about myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your body
- 📫 How to reach me: smoke signal or by tagging @Saynator or @Gaynator on ANY social network. Believe me, I'm there.
- 😄 Pronouns: Yours
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fun is subjective.
PS: This definitely is Gaynator, not just some random person that found out he forgot to log himself out from a public computer. *wink, wink*
